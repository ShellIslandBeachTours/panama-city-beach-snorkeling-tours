<div> <p>Our mission is to work with purpose. Panama City Beach dolphin tours are educational experiences that allow you to appreciate and understand wildlife. <i>Nature</i>  We are an eco-friendly company and do everything possible to protect wildlife. You will be a blessing to dolphins if you choose an eco-tour company that cares.</p><p>We will depart into Historic Grand Lagoon for a 25-minute relaxing cruise out to our snorkel area, Shell Island! Along the way, be on the lookout for dolphins and other sea animals in their natural habitat. When we arrive, we will anchor in the Gulf of Mexico or along Shell Island where you can snorkel for seashells and catch a glimpse of the underwater world, learn about local sea-life, or just relax and float while you take in the sun. You can also wade through the shallow water onto Shell Island to hunt for shells. After we have spent some time at Shell Island, we will end the trip with a ride out to the Gulf of Mexico to search for dolphins and sight-see along the way.</p><p>If you plan to visit Shell Island during your trip, you can rent snorkeling gear with Panama City Snorkeling Tours, which transports you to and from the destination.</p></div>
