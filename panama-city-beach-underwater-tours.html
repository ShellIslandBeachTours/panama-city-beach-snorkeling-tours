<div> <p>Caladesi Island is located at the northern end Clearwater Beach. It can be reached via ferry. It boasts turquoise waters and sugar-soft white sandy sands, making this one of Florida's most beautiful strands.</p><p>Panama City Beach water refers to fresh water that comes from spring-fed bodies of water. It is emitted through a pipe under Front Beach Road, and then out towards the Gulf of Mexico. According to the city's website, "These discolored outflows represent a unique aspect in our lake ecosystem."</p><p>You should only try to reach Shell Island by boat or jet ski, as the currents can be too strong to paddle board to the island.</p><br><br><h2>Panama City Beach Underwater Tours - Temperature</h2><ul><li>Marina</li><li>Beach</li><li>Conservation</li><li>Video</li><li>Depth</li><li>Unique</li><li>Exploration</li><li>History</li><li>Culture</li><li>Lagoon</li><li>Dazzling</li></ul></div>

It boasts a large deck that has plenty of covered seating to cool off in summer, and an outside area for those who wish to capture the perfect Panama City Beach Sunset.</p><p>Snorkeling can be enjoyed by all ages.
