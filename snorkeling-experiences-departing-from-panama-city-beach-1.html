We felt comfortable, were able to have fun, and we also learned a lot. <b>Dazzling</b>  Captain Lorraine was friendly and knowledgeable.</p><p>You should not take dead coral from the beach to make souvenirs.

We selected dolphin sightings for most of the time.</p><p>Snorkeling involves swimming on the surface of water using a snorkel, mask, and fins. The snorkel allows you to see underwater clearly, and the mask allows you to breathe in the water with your face. Snorkeling is much easier than swimming because you can relax face down and breathe easily. A Shell Island Shuttle snorkel trip includes all snorkel equipment.</p><p>Gratuities are a standard practice in the charter boat industry. Tips make up a significant portion of the income of a captain on a charter boat. This is a way to express appreciation for the service your captain has provided.</p></div>
