<div><p>Now that you’ve walked the miles of sugar-white sandy beaches of Panama City Beach and gone swimming in the surf, it’s time to explore beneath the waves. The emerald green waters of the Gulf of Mexico are home to an abundance of sea life. Are you ready for a snorkeling tour?</p><p>Avoid touching corals, fish, or turtles. You can only touch sand, rock, and water safely (and your fins). Learn how to take a break in water by reading our snorkeling etiquette pages. <b>History</b>  Use sunscreen that isn't harmful.</p><p>The “Privateer”, is a 52 foot, U.S. <b>Beach</b>  Coast Guard Certified Catamaran that carries up to 78 passengers.
