<div> <p>Captain Croix was extraordinary. He was very knowledgeable. We decided what was important to him and he chose dolphin sightings for the majority.</p><p>There are many small marine species that can be found along the jetty, including tropical fish, crabs, and rays. Sometimes you may be lucky enough encounter a bottlenose dolphin, or even a sea turtle. The inland shoreline of Shell Island will lead you into St. Andrew Bay. It will take you through shallow seagrass flats to reach a completely other marine biosystem.</p><p>You can relax on the sandy beach at Shell Island's Gulf Shore when it is time for relaxation. Enjoy a relaxing day on the sand and walk along the shore to find shells. Visit Shell Island to see why it is so popular in Panama City Beach. <b>Nature</b>  Contact us at (850), 756-7510, or visit us in 3605 Oakbrook Ln for your Shell Island snorkeling adventure.</p> </div>
