<div><p>Chartering a boat, participating in a lobster snorkeling trip or snorkeling from Florida beaches with coral reefs and submerged rocks are all ways to get to the lobsters. Look for cracks in the rocks or reefs below the boat or beach as you swim out.</p><p>When answering the question "How far can they swim out to the ocean", consider how far they are being pulled by currents. They can travel approximately 48km or 30 miles on average.</p><p>Customers can cancel up to 48 hours before their arrival date to receive a full refund, minus a $5 fee. Cancellations made after this time will not be accepted. The tour can be rescheduled at a later date or time if the weather is not favorable. <b>Lagoon</b>  <b>Depth</b>  As long as the cancellation deadline is not exceeded, customers can make changes to their reservation without incurring any charges. No-shows are not eligible for a refund.</p> <i>Temperature</i></div>

<div> <p>Based on our booking data and information from the provider from the past 30 days, this experience is likely to sell out through Viator.</p><p>The unspoiled Shell Island is home to a wide variety of wildlife including sea turtles and bottlenose dolphins. <i>Dazzling</i>  Clear, calm waters are available around the rock jetties, making it a great spot for beginners and advanced snorkelers. After your snorkeling trip, you can head to the beach of sugary-white sandy sand.</p><p>Undiscovered underwater worlds await you beyond the calm waves and sandy shores of Panama City Beach. Snorkeling makes a great family activity. Take your snorkel gear with you or rent from a local outfitter to enjoy a breathtaking swim in a bay. You can snorkel solo or with a professional, or add a dolphin trip to your excursion.<br><br><h2>Panama City Beach Snorkel Boat Trips - Conservation</h2><ol><li>Beach</li><li>Conservation</li><li>Video</li><li>Depth</li><li>Unique</li><li>Exploration</li><li>History</li><li>Culture</li><li>Lagoon</li><li>Dazzling</li><li>Biologist</li><li>Estuary</li><li>Gulf</li></ol> Learn everything you need on snorkeling in the PCB.</p></div>

Don’t forget to ask about renting one of our underwater cameras for your adventure – you’ll love the memories.</p><p>Snorkeling offers a wonderful way for swimmers to see the marine life close-up. After a bit of instruction, even a beginner can breathe comfortably using snorkel gear while enjoying the view from a mask. Shell Island's grassy shallows will be explored by our experienced and professional guide. You may even see sea horses, sea stars and other marine life in the shallow waters of Shell Island. You may even be able to have a close encounter as you cruise above a coral Reef in search of colorful tropical fish and sea-urchins.<br><br><h2>Panama City Beach Snorkel Boat Trips - Unique</h2><ol><li>Marina</li><li>Beach</li><li>Conservation</li><li>Video</li><li>Depth</li><li>Unique</li><li>Exploration</li><li>History</li><li>Culture</li><li>Lagoon</li><li>Dazzling</li></ol> You can also find an uninhabited or two shells you could take home.</p><p>Hypoxia (low oxygen) to the brain is what causes "Sweet Water Blackout."

<div><p>There are a few rules to follow when tipping a captain of a boat. The captain receives the tip in cash and then divides it equally among the crew. Charters don't have the same rules as restaurants.</p><p>While contact lenses can be worn, it is possible to get your contacts lost if the mask floods. If this happens, it will be the same as swimming with your lenses inside. It is possible to wear contacts underwater by purchasing a prescription lens dive snorkel mask.</p><p>Sand crabs are the answer! Sand crabs can be seen only at night, and are often only visible with flashlights.</p><br><br><h2>Panama City Beach Snorkel Boat Trips - Clear</h2><ol><li>Video</li><li>Depth</li><li>Unique</li><li>Exploration</li><li>History</li><li>Culture</li><li>Lagoon</li><li>Dazzling</li><li>Biologist</li><li>Estuary</li><li>Gulf</li></ol></div>
